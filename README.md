# Turing 1810 Frontend Mod1 Static Comp Challenge 1
### Assignment - Recreate given static composition WITHOUT using CSS grid. CSS flex is allowed.

No assets were given. We could not take liberties with the layout, but our creative license included : Copy, images, icons, and color palette. Page was required to be responsive down to 320px. Extra implementations I added were: Dummy divs that spread the bottom row to the left for a cleaner look, and a dropdown menu for the navigation bar once the width of the screen reduced past a certain width. 

Static composition assigned:
